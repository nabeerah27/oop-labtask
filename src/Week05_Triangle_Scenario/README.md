<h2 align="center">ðŸŸ¢ TRIANGLE SCENARIO</h2>

---

## Problem Statement

First Draw UML. Java developers follow java rules and python developers will follow python rules.

Write a class Triangle with three instance double variables, namely `sideA`, `sideB`, and `sideC`. The class must have the following methods:

- A default constructor that creates a triangle with all sides being equal to 1.0.
- A one-parameter constructor that accepts a double and creates an equilateral triangle with all sides equal to the passed parameter.
- A two-parameter constructor that accepts two doubles `x` and `y`, and creates an isosceles triangle with sides `x`, `x`, and `y`.
- A three-parameter constructor that accepts three doubles `x`, `y`, and `z`, and creates a triangle with sides respectively equal to `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- A constructor that accepts a reference to an existing triangle and creates a corresponding clone; it should also return a reference to the cloned triangle.

In the Java version, implement `getters` and `setters` using standard naming conventions.

Include a class method `objectCount()` which returns the current count of how many objects of type `Triangle` have been created. 
Include an instance method `perimeter()` which calculates and returns the perimeter of the triangle. 
Include another instance method `isRightAngled()` which returns true if the triangle is right-angled, and false otherwise. 
Finally, include an instance method `toString()` which returns a suitable string representation of the current object.

## Concepts Used:

- Encapsulation â†’ private fields (`sideA`, `sideB`, `sideC`) with public getters & setters.
- Constructor Overloading â†’ multiple constructors to handle different triangle types.
- Copy Constructor â†’ creates a new triangle object by cloning an existing one (safe, since primitive fields are copied by value).
- Static Variable â†’ used for counting number of `Triangle` objects created.
- Instance Methods â†’
    - `perimeter()` calculates sum of sides.
    - `isRightAngled()` uses **Pythagoras Theorem** for validation.
- Method Overriding â†’ `toString()` provides a custom object description.

## Learning Notes:

- Practiced constructor overloading to support different initialization patterns.
- Learned to use a static counter for tracking created objects.
- Applied Pythagoras theorem for checking right-angled triangles.
- Strengthened encapsulation by combining setters and providing controlled getters.
- Implemented `toString()` override to display detailed object information.  
- Understood the role of a copy constructor; cloning an object creates a new independent object 
(changes in the clone do not affect the original when fields are primitives).
