## Learning notes

- Represented 2D vectors as objects with `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Implemented *addition*, *subtraction*, *dot product*, *cross product*, and *scalar multiplication* for vectors.
- Calculated vector magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem.
- Computed angle between vectors in both radians and degrees.
- Checked if two vectors are perpendicular using dot product = 0 (with floating-point tolerance).
- Checked if two vectors are parallel using cross product = 0 (with floating-point tolerance).
- Separated operations into a dedicated `Operations` class for better code organization.
- Overrode toString() method to improve readability of vector outputs.
- Applied formatted printing for clean and precise console output.
