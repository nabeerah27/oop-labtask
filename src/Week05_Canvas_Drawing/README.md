## Concepts Used

- Inheritance 
- Composition
- Encapsulation 
- Method overriding
- Event-driven GUI concepts from Swing.

## Learning Notes

- Used `JPanel` (via the `Canvas` class) to create a custom drawing area and override `paintComponent(Graphics g)` for rendering shapes.
- Integrated `JFrame` from Swing to display the custom panel on a window.
- Learned the importance of calling `super.paintComponent(g)` to clear the background before redrawing.
- Implemented dynamic storage of drawable objects using ArrayList<Line>.
- Applied composition:
  - `Line` contains two `Point` objects.
  - `Canvas` contains multiple `Line` objects.
  - `Pen` interacts with `Canvas` to draw lines.
- Practiced working with custom classes (`Point`, `Line`, `Pen`, `Canvas`) in a structured, object-oriented design.
- Applied method chaining concepts like `moveTo()` and `lineTo()` for sequential drawing operations.
