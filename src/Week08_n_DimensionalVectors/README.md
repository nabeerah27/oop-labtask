<h2 align="center">ðŸŸ¢ N - DIMENSIONAL VECTOR</h2>

---

## Problem Statement

1. Design a class `Vector` that internally stores coordinates using `List<Double>` (e.g., `ArrayList<Double>`).

2. Encapsulation
   - Keep the internal list private so it cannot be accessed directly.
   - Provide public methods to interact with the vector.
   
3. Define the public interface with methods:
   - `get(int i)` : return coordinate at index `i`.
   - `set(int i, double val)` : update coordinate at index `i`.
   - `length()` : return the number of dimensions.
   - `add(Vector other)` : return a new vector that is the sum of this vector and `other`.
   - `clone()` : return a deep copy of this vector (new list with the same values).
   - `toString()` : string representation of the vector.
   - `equals(Object o)` : check vector equality.
   
4. Polymorphism
    - Override `toString()` and `equals(Object o)` from `Object`.
    - Implement `Cloneable` and override `clone()`.

5. Iteration
   - Implement `Iterable<Double>` so the vector can be used in a for-each loop.

6. Testing / Demonstration
    - Show usage in a `main` method or driver class.
    - Example: create vectors, modify them, iterate using `for(double v : vector)`, compare vectors with `equals()`, and demonstrate cloning.

## Concepts Used

- Encapsulation â€” private `coordinates` list with controlled access.
- Constructor overloading â€” multiple ways to initialize vectors.
- Iterable interface â€” enabled iteration over vector elements using `for-each`.
- Cloneable interface â€” implemented deep copy of vector objects.
- Method overriding â€” `toString()`, `equals()`, and `clone()` for customized behavior.
- Operator-like methods â€” `add()` method to perform vector addition.

## Learning notes

- Practiced constructor overloading: empty vector, vector with size (filled with zeros), and vector from list.
- Learned how to implement deep copying using the `clone()` method.
- Understood how to implement custom iterators instead of relying only on built-in iterators.
- Strengthened understanding of `equals()` for object comparison beyond reference checking.
- Reinforced index validation to avoid runtime errors when accessing elements.
- Improved debugging and design by overriding `toString()` for clean and readable vector output.
