## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Java class Range that mimics Pythonâ€™s built-in range() function.

## Concepts Used:

- Encapsulation: Private fields (start, end, step, length) with controlled access.
- Constructor Overloading: Multiple constructors for flexible initialization (end only, start-end, start-end-step).
- Validation:
    - Step cannot be zero.
    - Index validation with Python-style negative indexing.
    - Length calculation depending on step direction.
- Iterable Interface: Implemented to support enhanced for-each loop iteration.
- Custom Iterator: Anonymous inner class generates elements lazily (no full list stored).
- Method Overriding:
    - `toString()`: produces a list-like string representation.
    - `equals()`: compares ranges logically (if implemented).
- Reusability Modularity: Validation logic extracted to Validator class for clean design.

--- 

## Learning Notes:

- Translated Python range functionality to Java using OOP concepts.
- Simulated Python-style negative indexing in Java.
- Practiced constructor chaining to reduce duplication.
- Implemented Iterable and Iterator to understand for-each loop internals.
- Debugged edge cases: forward range, backward range, invalid step, empty ranges.
- Learned how Python features (range, slicing, negative indices) can be recreated in Java.
