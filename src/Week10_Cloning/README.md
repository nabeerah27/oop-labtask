<h2 align="center">ðŸŸ¢ CLONING </h2>

## Problem Statement

1. Provide java code to demonstrate successful execution of given code in
   [main](code/Cloning.java)
2. Comment on what could get wrong in the context of shallow copy vs deep copy. 
3. Support your answer using stack-heap illustration.

## Concepts Used:

- Encapsulation: Private fields (`anArray`, `value`) with controlled access.
- Array Initialization: Using `new int[]{...}` syntax in the constructor.
- Primitive vs Reference Behavior:
  - `value` (primitive) â†’ copied directly in cloning.
  - `anArray` (reference) â†’ requires explicit deep copy.
- Iteration: `increment()` method updates all elements using a `for` loop and `value`. 
- Cloning:
   - `Cloneable` interface implemented to enable cloning.
   - `super.clone()` creates a shallow copy for fields.
   - Explicit `anArray.clone()` ensures a deep copy of the internal array.
- Method Overriding:
   - `clone()` : returns a safe deep copy for Object. 
   - `toString()`: prints `value` field and builds clean string output to prints array elements using `StringBuilder`.

## Learning Notes:

- Learned difference between **shallow copy** (shared array reference) and **deep copy** (independent copy).
- Observed that `super.clone()` handles primitives automatically, but not reference types.
- Discovered that `super.clone()` only copies object references â€” we must handle arrays separately.
- Practiced overriding `clone()` safely in Java.
- Used `StringBuilder` for efficient output formatting.
- Strengthened understanding of **stack vs heap** references in Java.
