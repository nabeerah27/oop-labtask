<h2 align="center">🟢 BIRTHDAY PARADOX</h2>

## Problem Statement

The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room
will have the same birthday is more than half, provided n, the number of
people in the room, is more than 23. This property is not really a paradox,
but many people find it surprising. Design a Java program that can test
this paradox by a series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays,
which test this paradox for n = 5,10,15,20,...,100.

### Structure Overview :

- `BirthdayParadox` – Simulates birthday experiments and calculates duplicate probabilities.
- `Utils` – Handles input validation and formatted table printing.
- `Program` – Contains the `run()` method to execute the simulation.
- `Main` – Contains `main()` method to execute the `run()` method.

## Concepts Used

- Generate random birthdays using `Random.nextInt(365) + 1`.
- Detect duplicates efficiently using `HashSet` with add()` and `contains()`.
- Repeat tasks using loops: for people in a trial, for multiple trials, and for testing group sizes in steps of 5.
- Validate input using conditionals (`if(numPeople <= 0)` and `if(trials <= 0)`).
- Format strings for output: `String.length()`, `" ".repeat(n)` for centering, `String.format("%.3f", probability)` for decimal formatting, `String.valueOf()` to convert numbers to strings.
- Use modular design with separate methods and classes.
- Print formatted, centered tables using `System.out.printf()` for clarity.

## Learning Notes

- Probability of shared birthdays rises quickly as group size increases (23 people → ~50% chance).
- `HashSet` allows fast and memory-efficient detection of duplicates.
- Multiple trials reduce randomness errors and give more accurate probability estimates.
- Input validation prevents meaningless simulations with negative or zero values.
- Centered tables and formatted output make results easier to read and compare
- Looping through group sizes helps visualize the “paradox effect” across different room sizes.
- Modular code structure improves readability, maintainability, and reuse of logic.
- String manipulation is essential for creating neat, aligned, and readable outputs in console programs.
