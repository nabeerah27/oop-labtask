## Concepts Used

- Encapsulation â€” using private fields with getters and setters
- Parameterized and default constructors
- Static utility methods for performing operations
- Separation of concerns â€” Operations logic in one class, simplification in another
- Recursive algorithm â€” GCD calculation
- Data validation â€” checking denominator for zero and handling negative denominators
- Method overriding â€” toString() for clean output formatting

---

## Keywords Used

- private
- this
- static
- return
- if-else
- Math.abs()

---

## Learning notes

- Practiced method decomposition â€” each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is a separate method, improving clarity and reusability.
- Implemented recursive logic for calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is essential for simplifying fractions.
- Applied fraction simplification automatically after each operation to ensure results are always in their simplest form.
- Used validation checks to handle special cases like zero denominators and negative signs in fractions.
- Reinforced overriding `toString()` for user-friendly output representation of rational numbers.
- Strengthened understanding of passing objects as parameters and returning new object instances from static methods.
